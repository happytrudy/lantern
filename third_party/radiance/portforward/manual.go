// surface as Forwarder but does no UPnP work. The user is expected to
// have configured a port forward on their router by hand and supplied
// the port number out-of-band. This implementation reports the same
// value for both the external and internal port — callers needing
// distinct external/internal ports should use the UPnP-based Forwarder
// (which can negotiate them) or build their own portForwarder.
//
// Use case: networks where UPnP is disabled or unavailable (router has
// UPnP off for security, ISP-provided gateways without IGD, networks
// behind double-NAT). The UPnP-based Forwarder fails in those
// environments; this type lets callers bypass discovery entirely.
