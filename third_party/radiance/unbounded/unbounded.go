// Package unbounded manages the broflake / Unbounded widget-proxy lifecycle.
//
// Unbounded is the WebRTC-based donor mode for Lantern's Share My Connection
// feature: the local user contributes bandwidth to censored users via short-
// lived WebRTC sessions brokered through a discovery server, without exposing
// a long-lived inbound port the way the samizdat-over-UPnP "Share My
// Connection" mode does. It's the lower-bandwidth, lower-risk, universally-
// applicable alternative to SmC — works on networks where UPnP is disabled
// or unavailable, and the peer's residential IP isn't tied to a single
// long-lived inbound listener.
//
// Three conditions must all hold for the widget proxy to actually run:
//
//  1. settings.UnboundedKey is true (local opt-in via the UI toggle)
//  2. server-side cfg.Features[UNBOUNDED] is enabled (server says go)
//  3. server-side cfg.Unbounded provides discovery + egress URLs
//
// The manager subscribes to config.NewConfigEvent and recomputes the
// running state on every config update; it also re-evaluates when
// SetEnabled flips the local toggle. Each consumer connection change
// (accept / disconnect) emits a ConnectionEvent on the radiance event
// bus so the same Flutter globe used for SmC can render arcs without
// caring which protocol produced them.
