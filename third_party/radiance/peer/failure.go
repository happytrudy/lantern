// Start's failures reach the user as raw Go error text: the desktop share card
// renders the returned error verbatim. A peer that failed because the machine
// was offline showed this:
//
//	register with lantern-cloud: send: all transports failed: transport
//	smart: timed out, transport errors: transport proxyless: dial tcp:
//	lookup api.iantem.io: no such host
//
// Four nested wraps naming four internals, and the one fact the user could act
// on — the network was down — is the last clause of the innermost error. This
// turns the tree into one line, and keeps the tree in the log.
//
// Only failures we can actually name are rewritten. Everything else keeps its
// original error, because a vague-but-honest wrap beats a confident guess.

// Reason is a stable, machine-readable classification of a Start failure. It
// exists so the UI can localize these later without another radiance release:
// the message strings below are English, and a UI that only has the string can
// only display it.
